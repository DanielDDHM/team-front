The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn generate`

It asks for 3 or 4 simple questions in order to add styling or headers.

Do take in mind that this script only creates the essencial files to run.<br />
